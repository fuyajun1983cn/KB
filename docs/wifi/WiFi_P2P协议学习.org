        - Enterprise manageability

* WiFi P2P Framework

     1. A P2P Group is a WiFi P2P network that may include two types
        of devices
        - P2P Device 
          WiFi CERTIFIED™ device that is compliant with
          the WiFi P2P specification 
        - Legacy device 
          WiFi CERTIFIED™ device that is not compliant
          with the WiFi P2P specification
     2. P2P devices must be capable of two different roles in a P2P
        Group
        - P2P Group Owner : An =AP-like= capability that controls a
          WiFi P2P Group and enables P2P Device connectivity 
        - P2P Client : A WiFi =P2P-compliant= device that may connect to
          a P2P Group Owner
     3. Note : Legacy devices may only function as clients in a P2P
        Group. They see P2P Group Owners as APs.

* WiFi P2P Architecture
    1. A P2P Device is the fundamental component of a P2P Group
       - Capable of either an infrastructure or a P2P connection
       - Can always connect with another P2P Device
       - Supports both P2P Group Owner and P2P Client roles
       - Negotiates P2P Group Ownership with other P2P Devices
       - Must be WiFi CERTIFIED™ for WiFi Protected Setup™
       - Must be WiFi CERTIFIED™ for WMM®
       - Must Support P2P Discovery mechanisms
       - Must Support P2P Power Management mechanisms
       - May support Managed P2P Device operation
       - May support WLAN and P2P Group operation at the same time
       - May operate as a member of multiple P2P Groups simultaneously
         - Functionality is out of scope for this spec
    2. A P2P Group is a WiFi P2P network made of at least two WiFi
       enabled devices
       - One device mustbe a P2P Group Owner
       - The other device(s) are Clients (P2P Clients and/or Legacy
         Clients)
    3. Two types of P2P Groups
       - 1:1 P2P Group
         - One P2P Group Owner and one Client
       - 1:n P2P Group
         - One P2P Group Owner and n Clients (where n may be any
           combination of P2P Clients and Legacy Clients)
    4. A P2P Group functions similarly to an infrastructure BSS
       - Has a single SSID (the P2P wildcard SSID) and a single
         security domain
       - May have only one P2P Group Owner
       - P2P Group Owner has a similar role as an Access Point (AP)
       - Client(s) have similar roles as station(s) (STAs)
    5. Each P2P Group has a unique P2P Group ID
    6. Each P2P Group may be temporary(single-use) or
       persistent(repeated use)
    7. Key P2P Group Owner capabilities
       - Must provide BSS functionality and services for Clients (P2P
         and Legacy) associated to a P2P Group
       - Must provide WiFi Protected Setup™ Internal Registrar
         functionality for a P2P Group
       - May enable facilitated or direct communication between Clients
         in a P2P Group
       - May support P2P Concurrent Device capability
         - Ability to maintain simultaneous infrastructure (WLAN)
           connection in parallel with functioning as Group Owner of a
           P2P Group
       - May also support Cross-Connection (as added capability to P2P
         Concurrent Device)
         - Ability to provide Clients in a P2P Group with access to a
           simultaneous WLAN connection
    8. Key P2P Client capabilities
       - Must have the ability to join/function in infrastructure
         networks as typical STA
       - Must support WPS Enrollee functionality
    9. WiFi P2P protocol communication based on
       - P2P Information Element (P2P IE)
       - P2P Action frame
         - Group Owner Discoverability; P2P Presence; Group Owner
           Notice of Absence
       - P2P Public Action frame
         - Group Owner Negotiation; P2P Invitation; Device
           Discoverability; Provision Discovery
       - Extension to 802.11 Management Frames
         - Beacon, Probe Request, Probe Response,
           Association/Reassociation
    10. Formats utilize the Vendor Specific Information Element and
        Vendor Specific Action frame in IEEE Std 802.11-2007
        - Each P2P Group has a single SSID and a single security domain
        - Each P2P Group has a unique P2P Group ID
        - WiFi P2P has a WiFi Alliance-specific OUI
        - OUI type indicates a WiFi P2P specification version
    11. A Number of P2P Attributes are defined
        - A Single P2P IE carries one or more P2P Attributes

* WiFi P2P Protocol Overview
** 基本流程概述
   1. User discovers P2P Devices in range
   2. User selects which of the discovered P2P Devices to connect to
      and enters Provisioning information (e.g. WPS PIN)
   3. Negotiate which device shall become P2P Group Owner (AP-like
      entity)
   4. Use authentication in WPS to ensure that these are correct
      devices (same PIN)
      - P2P Group Owner supplies P2P SSID & WPA2 PSK using WPS
   5. P2P Group Owner starts P2P Group session and Client joins P2P
      GroupDevice
   
** P2P Device Discovery

    1. P2P Discovery is comprised of three primary parts:
       - Device Discovery facilitates two P2P Devices arriving on a
         common channel and exchanging device information
       - Group Formation forms a new P2P Group and determines which P2P
         Device will serve as the P2P Group Owner
       - P2P Invitation has two uses
         1. Invite a P2P Device to join an existing P2P Group
         2. Invokes a previously formed Persistent P2P Group
       - (Optional)Service Discovery for discovering higher-layer services prior
         to establishing a P2P device connection
       - Occurs only on three Social Channels(Channel 1,6,11 in the 2.4GHz
         band)
    2. Uses Probe Request and Probe Response frames to exchange device
       information
    3. Two P2P-specific Device Discovery states
       - Search state: transmit one or more Probe Request frames on
         each Social Channel
       - Listen state : wait on a specific Social Channel (the Listen
         Channel) to receive Probe Request frames
    4. Scan for a P2P Device advertising P2P service
    5. Device transmits one or more Probe Request frames on each Social
       Channel
       - Probe Request frame contents
         - P2P IE
         - WPS IE
         - SSID field = P2P Wildcard SSID
         - BSSID field = Wildcard BSSID
       - Destination Address
         - Destination Address must be either the Broadcast Address or
           the P2P Device Address of the listening device
       - Optionally
         - Specific Device Type attribute in the WPS IE, or
         - Specific P2P Device ID attribute in the P2P IE.
    6. P2P Device monitors a specific Social Channel, advertising P2P
       service
       - Monitoring for Probe Request frame containing
         - P2P IE, P2P Wildcard SSID, Wildcard BSSID, and Destination
           Address
           - Destination Address matches either Broadcast Address or
             P2P Device Address of listening device
         - Optionally
           - Device Type value that matches any Requested Device Type
             attribute in the WPS IE, or
           - Device Address matches the Device Address in the P2P IE
             Device ID attribute
    7. Listen State restrictions
       - P2P Devices in the Find Phase
         - Must Listen for specific time periods and be constantly
           available during these periods
       - P2P Devices not in Find Phase
         - May stay in the Listen State for an extended period
           - Should be available to Listen for at least a contiguous
             period of 500ms every 5s
           - Shorter Listen duration or interruption of Listen State
             may result in lengthened or unreliable device discovery
    8. Probe Request/Probe Response discovers device type,
       manufacturer, device name, etc.
    9. One or more P2P IE and WPS IE are included in the Probe Response
       - A probe request intended only for P2P Devices shall include a
         P2P IE
       - Searches can be narrowed to a specific P2P Device
         - Include the P2P Device ID attribute in the P2P IE
       - Searches can be narrowed to specific device types (i.e.,
         search for all printers)
         - Include one or more Requested Device Type attributes in the
           WPS IE
       - The WPS IE also allows a P2P Device to advertise
         human-readable device-specific information such as a
         meaningful device description

*** Scan Phase
    1. Collects information about surrounding devices and/or networks
       on all channels supported by the P2P Device
       - Uses scanning process as defined in IEEE std 802.11-2007
       - Identifies other P2P Devices and established P2P Groups
       - Identifies the best potential Operating Channel for
         establishing a new P2P Group
       - P2P Devices may scan for P2P Groups and 802.11 infrastructure
         networks simultaneously
    2. Scan Filter Methods
       - Scan only for P2P Devices and P2P Groups
       - Scan for specific P2P device type(s), e.g., all Printers
       - Scan for specific P2P Device (either by address or friendly
         name)
    3. Optional Scan Enhancement
       - Use Service Discovery to ensure compatible services exist on a
         device (e.g., a desired print method or display type)
    4. Used to ensures that two simultaneously searching P2P Devices
       will arrive on a common channel to establish communications
       - P2P Devices cycle between Listen and Search states
         - P2P Device waits on one of three Social Channels for Probe
           Request Frames (Listen)
         - P2P Device sends Probe Request Frames on each of the three
           Social Channels (Search)
       - Time spent in each cycle of the Listen State is randomized to
         prevent lock-stepping between two devices and ensure
         convergence

*** 创建一个连接

    - Users can select which device to connect to based on its device
      name, services, and so on
    - If the target P2P Device is not part of a P2P Group, a new P2P
      Group is formed using the P2P Group Formation Procedure
    - If the target P2P Device is already part of a P2P Group, the
      searching P2P Device may seek to join the group
      - Use WiFi Protected Setup™ (WPS) to obtain credentials and
        authenticate
        - WPS handshakes take place on the Operating Channel of the
          P2P Group Owner

** P2P Group Formation

   - Group Formation procedure involves two phases
     1. Determination of the P2P Group Owner
        - Negotiated –Two P2P Devices negotiate for P2P Group Owner
          role based on their desires/capabilities to be a P2P Group
          Owner, OR
        - Selected –P2P Group Owner role “established” at formation or
          at an application-level
     2. Provisioning of the P2P Group
        - Establishment of the P2P Group session using the appropriate credentials
        - Uses WiFi Protected Setup™ to exchange credentials

*** Special Provisioning Consideration

    1. Completion of P2P Group Formation procedure is required within
       =15 seconds=
    2. Special consideration required to meet the time limit for P2P
       Group Formation
       - Up to =two minutes= required for completion of WiFi Protected
         Setup™ when waiting for user input
    3. P2P Device must obtain any information required to execute
       provisioning in advance of P2P Group Formation
       - Use the information supplied, during the Listen state, in the
         WPS ConfigMethods attribute of a Probe Response to determine
         information to retrieve from user
         - E.g., PIN from a label, PIN from a display, etc
       - P2P Device may trigger the required user action by sending a
         Provision Discovery Request with the appropriate ConfigMethods
         bit set

*** P2P Group Owner Role

    1. All P2P Groups require a P2P Device to take on the role of P2P
       Group Owner
    2. Some key responsibilities of P2P Group Owners
       - Assigns a globally unique P2P Group ID for the P2P Group at
         formation
       - Determine the SSID for each P2P Group
       - Select the Operating Channel of the P2P Group
         - Must follow any procedures required for operation in a
           certain frequency band in a particular regulatory domain
       - Determine the credentials required and be the authenticator
         for joining a P2P Group
         - Use WPA2-PSK Authentication, AES Encryption, Network Key
           Type of 64 Hex characters
         - Maintain a WPA-PSK passphrase for delivery to Legacy Clients
       - Serve as the WiFi Protected Setup™ Registrar
       - Be capable of acting as a DHCP server
         - Support IPv4 at a minimum
         - Support assignment of IP address, subnet mask and default
           gateway
       - Advertise the device information of the P2P Clients connected
         to a P2P Group

*** Group Owner Negotiation

    1. Two P2P Devices forming a P2P Group negotiate which will be the
       Group Owner
       - A P2P Device may decline Group Owner Negotiation for any
         reason
       - Group Owner negotiation relies on an Group Owner Intent
         attribute value and a Tie breaker bit to resolve the decision
         quickly
       - Group Owner Negotiation (and Group Formation) fails if both
         P2P Devices MUST be the Group Owner
       - P2P Devices remain on the common social channel until Group
         Owner Negotiation completes
    2. Device that wins the negotiation assumes the AP/Registrar role
       and becomes the P2P Group Owner

*** Provisioning

    1. Newly established P2P Group Owner starts a P2P Group session
       using the credentials determined
    2. Uses the Operating Channel indicated during Group Owner
       Negotiation
       - If not available, will use another channel from the Channel
         List
       - P2P Client may have to scan to find the P2P Group Owner if the
         Operating Channel is not available
    3. WiFi Protected Setup™ sequence executes in the following manner
       - P2P Group Owner serves as the AP with Internal Registrar
         - It shall only allow association by P2P Device with which it
           is in Group Formation with
         - Since the user has entered the WPS PIN or triggered WPS
           pushbutton functionality on both devices, the registrar
           shall send M2 in response to M1
       - P2P Client shall serve as the STA enrollee
         - It shall associate to the P2P Group Owner device with which
           it is in Group Formation

*** Autonomous P2P Group
    1. P2P Group Formation starts with determination of the P2P Group
       Owner
       - P2P group owners may be determined
         - Through Group Owner Negotiation process, or
         - Through configuration (autonomous)
    2. Autonomous P2P Groups
       - P2P Device starts an autonomous P2P Group by assuming the P2P
         Group Owner role
         - Group characteristics are determined by the P2P Device
           without negotiation with other devices
       - Some use cases for autonomous P2P Groups
         - Providing a P2P connection for Legacy Client(s)
           - A P2P Group must already exist for a Legacy Device to
             discover it
         - To offer a Cross Connection to a WLAN
         - Offering / managing higher-level services
           - i.e., public kiosk offering applications or upper layer
             services

** P2P Group Session
*** Communication within a P2P Group
    1. Communication within a P2P Group shall employ WPA2-Personal
       security with AES-CCMP as the encryption cipher
       - After a successful association, the resulting temporal keys
         shall be used to encrypt unicast and broadcast/multicast
         frames exchanged between the P2P Group Owner and its Clients
       - Same mechanism used in standard 802.11 communications
    2. To support higher layer data services using IP, the P2P Group
       Owner shall provide IP addresses through a DHCP server (IPv4
       minimum)
       - P2P Clients that use IP services shall be capable of acting as
         a DHCP Client

*** P2P Group Session Credentials
    1. P2P Group operation closely resembles infrastructure BSS
       operation per IEEE Std 802.11-2007
       - P2P Group Owner assumes the role of an AP
       - P2P Client assumes the role of an STA
    2. Credentials
       - WPA2-PSK / AES
       - Network Key of 64 hex characters
       - WPA2-PSK pass-phrase for Legacy Clients; at least 8 random
         ASCII letters/numbers
       - Delivery of a pass-phrase to Legacy Clients that do not
         support WPS is allowed but implementation is out of scope of
         the P2P specification
    3. SSID
       - Of the format =DIRECT-xy=
       - Where =xy= is two random ASCII letters/numbers
    4. P2P Group ID
       - Assigned by the P2P Group Owner; globally unique for each P2P
         Group formed
         - Contains the globally unique P2P Device Address of P2P Group Owner
         - Remains the same throughout the life of a P2P Group

*** P2P Group Owner Responsibilities
    1. Transmit Probe Responses in response to Probe Requests
    2. Transmit beacons advertising
       - the TSF (for timing synchronization)
       - Required operational parameters, supported capabilities,
         membership and services available within the P2P Group
    3. Respond to any Probe Request Frame containing the P2P IE with a
       Probe Response Frame containing the P2P IE
       - Set the SSID to the SSID of the P2P Group for all Probe
         Responses that it sends
       - Include WPS IE in all transmitted Beacon, Probe Request and
         Probe Response frames
       - Conform to relevant sections of IEEE Std 802.11-2007 when
         operating at 5GHz

*** P2P Client Discovery
    - P2P Client Discovery is a capability that enables a P2P Group
      Owner to advertise the device information for each P2P Client
      currently connected to a P2P Group
      - Information included in Probe Response frames as part of the
        P2P Group Info attribute
      - P2P Clients that leave a P2P Group are no longer advertised

*** P2P Invitation
    1. P2P Invitation
       - P2P Group Owner may invite a P2P Device to become a P2P Client
         in its P2P Group
       - A P2P Client may invite another P2P Device to join the P2P
         Group to which it belongs so it may use a supported service
       - A P2P Device may request a provisioned Persistent P2P Group to
         be invoked
    2. P2P Devices rely on an optional P2P Invitation Procedure
       signaling mechanism to achieve this invitation
       - P2P Invitation Request frame is transmitted by a P2P Group
         Owner or a P2P Client in that P2P Group
       - Upon receipt of the P2P Invitation Request, a P2P Device that
         supports the P2P Invitation Procedure signaling mechanism
         transmits a P2P Invitation Response frame
       - The decision to accept the invitation is left to the invited
         P2P Device
         - Invited P2P Devices may also pass the invitation request to
           higher application layers for evaluation

*** Persistent Groups
    1. Unlike Temporary P2P Groups that exist for only a single
       session, a P2P Persistent Group may be re-invoked at a future
       time to start additional sessions after its initial formation
    2. P2P Persistent Groups may be restarted without repeating
       Provisioning
       - P2P Devices in a successfully provisioned P2P Persistent Group
         must store the associated P2P Group ID and Credentials
         - Eliminates the need for users to repeat provisioning such as
           WPS PIN, etc.
       - P2P Group Owner remains the same in subsequent sessions

*** Invoking a Persistent P2P Group
    1. A P2P Group Owner may invoke a Persistent P2P Group at any time
       - Autonomously, such as in response to request from a higher
         layer
       - After a successful P2P Invitation Request and Response
         exchange with a member of the Persistent Group
    2. A P2P Client may re-invoke a Persistent P2P Group
       - P2P Device must first discover the P2P Group Owner for the
         Persistent P2P Group
         - The operating channel for the group may not be available so
           the requesting Device may need to scan the channels in the
           Channel List to find the P2P Group Owner
       - After Discovery, the P2P Device must then successfully
         complete a P2P Invitation exchange with the P2P Group Owner 

*** P2P Persistent Group Reconnection
    1. A P2P Group Owner may invoke previously formed P2P Persistent
       Groups without user intervention
       - Capability advertised via Persistent Reconnect bit in P2P
         Group capabilities list
       - The P2P Group Owner device may use the Listen state to remain
         discoverable
    2. A P2P Persistent Group is ended when the P2P Group Owner deletes
       the stored Credentials for the P2P Persistent Group

*** P2P Discovery and Group Formation Examples
    1. User and P2P Protocol Interactions

       [[./images/2016/2016011101.png]]

    2. Forming a Group between two P2P Devices

       [[./images/2016/2016011102.png]]

       - User discovers P2P Devices within range

       - User selects a discovered P2P device to connect to and enters
         Provisioning Information such as a WPS PIN

       - P2P Devices negotiate P2P Group Ownership

         - Most appropriate device becomes P2P Group Owner (e.g. TV)

       - Use authentication in WPS to ensure that the correct devices
         (WPS PIN) are connected

         - WPS PIN has already been entered to speed provisioning

         - P2P Group Owner (TV) supplies SSID and WPA2 PSK using WPS

       - P2P Group Owner starts P2P Group session and P2P Client joins
         P2P Group

    3. Adding a P2P Device to an existing Group

       [[./images/2016/2016011103.png]]

       - New P2P Device discovers presence of existing P2P Group

         - P2P Group Owner responds to Probe Request during scan

       - P2P Group Owner provisions credentials to Client using WPS

         - Must use PIN or PBC method

       - New Client joins the P2P Group

    4. Discovering a Device in a P2P Group: Forming a Direct Connection

       [[./images/2016/2016011104.png]]

       - Camera is searching for a Printer that is already in a P2P
         Group

       - P2P Group Owner responds with P2P Client Info Descriptors of
         P2P Devices in its Group

         - P2P Client does not respond to Probe Requests

       - Camera may communicate directly with Printer after receiving
         P2P Device Address to perform Service Discovery, Group
         Formation, data exchange, etc.

    5. Adding a Device to a Group by Invitation

       [[./images/2016/2016011105.png]]

       - Group Owner searches for a device of a specific type (printer)

       - Printer is in Listen mode and responds to Probe Requests

       - P2P Group Owner invites Printer to join the P2P Group

       - Group Owner supplies SSID and WPA2 PSK using WPS

       - Printer joins the P2P group

** P2P State Machine

    [[./images/2016/2016120104.png]]
    
* Power Management and WiFi P2P Technology

** P2P Power Management
   1. P2P supports power saving mechanisms for P2P Group Owners and P2P
      Clients
      - Based on legacy PS and WMM-PS power management mechanisms
      - Adapted mechanisms are referred to as P2P-PS and P2P-WMM-PS
   2. Two adaptations allow for P2P Group Owner absence periods
      - Opportunistic Power Save
      - Notice of Absence
   3. Addresses requirements of target use cases:
      - Burst traffic (i.e., file transfer, synchronization, printing)
      - WMM Traffic Streams and other latency-sensitive traffic
      - Absence signaling for off-channel activities (concurrent use,
        scanning, etc.)
       
** P2P Power Management:Impact on Availability
   1. P2P Power Management saves power at the expense of
      - Reduced P2P Group Owner availability
      - Delays in Discoverability
      - Increased latency in upstream and downstream P2P Client
        transmissions
   2. P2P Clients may influence the use of P2P Power Saving by
      submitting a P2P Presence Request
      - A P2P Group Owner shall not use Opportunistic Power Save while
        it has active P2P Presence Requests

** Discovery Considerations
   - Searching devices must be aware that P2P power saving techniques
     may impact communication between searching and target P2P devices
     - Device Discoverability Responses may take multiple beacon
       periods

** Availability for Discoverability
   - To maintain P2P Device Discoverability, a P2P Group Owner must be
     present for an availability period called the CTWindow(Client
     Traffic Window)
     - The P2P Group Owner determines an appropriate CTWindow
       - CTWindow is an integral number of TU and is always less than
         the beacon interval
       - A P2P Group Owner that desires to be discoverable should
         select a CTWindow of at least 10 TU
     - P2P Group Owners will signal the CTWindow size and use of
       Opportunistic Power Save in Beacon frames and, where
       appropriate, Probe Response frames

** Opportunistic Power Save
   - Opportunistic Power Save allows a P2P Group Owner to save power
     on an opportunistic basis
     [[./images/2016/2016011106.png]]

   - After the end of each CTWindow, if the P2P Group Owner determines
     that all connected P2P Clients are in Doze state

     - The P2P Group Owner shall complete delivery of all queued
       broadcast/multicast frames

     - The P2P Group Owner may then enter Doze state until the next
       TBTT

   - The P2P Group Owner will remain awake as long as any Client is
     determined to be awake. A P2P Client is considered awake if:

     - 1) It is in active mode

     - 2) It is in Power Save Mode and has a WMM Unscheduled Service
       Period in progress or an unanswered PS-Poll

** Notice of Absence
   1. P2P Group Owners signal a planned absence with a Notice of
      Absence
      - May be used to signal a single absence or a periodic absence
      - Periodic absences are either limited in count or continuous
        (count = 255)
      - Notice of Absence timing may be altered by the P2P Group Owner
        at any time
   2. Addresses requirements of target use cases. For example:
      - Use a single absence to allow occasional off-channel scanning
      - Use periodic absence to power save
        - When a WMM Traffic Stream is established
        - For concurrent WLAN/P2P Group operation on different channels

** P2P Client Power Management
   1. P2P Clients use P2P PS or P2P WMM-PS as a non-AP STA
   2. P2P PS is the same as 802.11 PS except
      - When the Group Owner is using Opportunistic Power Save, P2P
        Clients may transition out of Power Save mode only at the
        beginning of a CTWindow
   3. P2P WMM-PS is the same as 802.11 WMM-PS except
      - P2P Devices shall not initiate a frame exchange that cannot be
        completed prior to the start of a scheduled absence period
      - P2P Clients shall generally not send frames to a P2P Group
        Owner during periods of absence

* Additional WiFi P2P Technology Capabilities

** Service Discovery
   - Optional Service Discovery procedure enables advertisement of
     supported services by higher layer applications (e.g., Bonjour,
     UPnP, Web Service Discovery) to other P2P devices
     - Frame exchange that can be performed at any time with any other
       discovered P2P Device
     - Leverages Generic Advertisement Service (GAS) protocol/exchange
       from IEEE P802.11u
   - Service Discovery can be used to ensure that two devices have
     compatible services
     - Get list of all services offered by a P2P Device
     - Get information about single or multiple services offered by a
       P2P Device
     - Communicate an update to the services offered by a P2P Device
   - The decision to perform Service Discovery is
     implementation-specific and beyond the scope of the P2P spec
   - Service Discovery Query issued by requesting device
     - Via Vendor-Specific content field of GAS Initial Request action
       frame
   - Service Discovery Response issued by targeted device
     - Via Vendor-Specific content field of GAS Initial Response
       action frame
   - Service Update Indicator support required for all P2P Devices
     that support Discovery
     - Counter sent in each Service Discovery Query and Service
       Discovery Response frame
       - Incremented every time a change occurs in the service
         information of the P2P Device sending the frame
     - Enables P2P Devices to cache service information of other P2P
       Devices
       - Receipt of Updated Indicator prompts the receiving device to
         flush and rewrite the cached service information for the
         sending device

** Concurrency: P2P and WLAN
   - A P2P device that can operate concurrently with a WLAN
     (infrastructure network) is considered a P2P Concurrent Device
     - Example : Laptop participating as P2P Client and simultaneously
       using a wireless LAN connection
       - Single radio can manage multiple connections
   - A P2P Group may operate in the same channel (and regulatory
     class) as a concurrently operating WLAN BSS
     [[./images/2016/2016011107.png]]

** Managed P2P Device Capability
   - Intended to protect Enterprise deployments from accidental
     creation of security risks by an unaware user of a P2P Device
   - A WLAN AP may optionally manage P2P devices
     - WLAN AP advertises P2P Management capability in Beacon, Probe
       Response and (Re) Association Response frames
   - A P2P device may optionally be a Managed P2P device
     - P2P Device advertises P2P Management capability in Probe
       Request and (Re) Assoc Request frames
   - A P2P Device also reports its P2P Device address and P2P
     Interface addresses to the WLAN AP at association to help with
     monitoring

* Additional WiFi P2P Technology Considerations

** WiFi P2P WLAN Coexistence
   [[./images/2016/2016011108.png]]

   - P2P Devices shall coexist well with nearby WiFi networks, both
     legacy and P2P
     - Follow standard W-Fi Alliance practices for protection of
       overlapping networks
   - Primary and Secondary P2P Coexistence Parameters provided to
     assist with fine tuning coexistence behaviors

** WiFi P2P Spectrum Coexistence in 5GHz
   [[./images/2016/2016011109.png]]

   - with AP‟s, P2P Devices that may operate as P2P Group Owners in
     the 5GHz band must be compliant with appropriate country
     regulations regarding coexistence with radar systems
     - Support for DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) may be required
       depending on supported channels.

   p2p相关的扩展有：
   - =NL80211_CMD_REMAIN_ON_CHANNEL=
   - =NL80211_CMD_CANCEL_REMAIN_ON_CHANNEL=
     This indicates to the device that it should stay on a given
     channel for a given time, to implement a P2P listen phase. Can
     also be canceled, since it is also used to implement off-channel
     TX for group negotiation or invitation
   - =NL80211_CMD_FRAME=
     previously =NL80211_CMD_ACTION=
     Transmit a management frame, with channel checking. This can be
     used during a =remain-on-channel= phase to transmit frames on that
     channel, or at other times to transmit on the operating
     channel. This also allows =off-channel= transmission, i.e. transmit
     on a given channel and wait for a response for a given time
     (including the ability to cancel the wait) which in a sense
     combines =REMAIN_ON_CHANNEL= and =MGMT_TX= into just a single =MGMT_TX=
     for some operations.
   - =NL80211_CMD_REGISTER_FRAME=
     Allow a userspace application to register for receiving a given
     type of (management) frame through nl80211, and also replying to
     it. Applications can also specify a filter so for example they
     don't have to handle all the different action frames but just a
     subset. For action frames, a side effect is that the kernel will
     not reply to unknown action frames when they are registered by
     userspace. Used by =wpa_supplicant= for P2P also for probe
     requests.
