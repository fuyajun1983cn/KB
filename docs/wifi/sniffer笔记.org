** Packet Capture Mechanism

** 可以使用WireShark完成的任务列表
   - Find the top talkers on the network
   - Identify the protocols and applications in use
   - Determine the average packets per second rate and bytes per
     second rate of an application or all network traffic on a link
   - List all hosts communicating
   - Learn the packet lengths used by a data transfer application
   - Recognize the most common connection problems
   - Spot delays between client requests due to slow processing
   - Locate misconfigured hosts
   - Detect network or host congestion that is slowing down file
     transfers
   - Identify asynchronous traffic prioritization
   - Graph HTTP flows to examine website referrals rates
   - Identify unusual scanning traffic on the network
   - Quickly identify HTTP error responses indicating client and
     server problems
   - Quickly identify VoIP error responses indicating client, server
     or global errors
   - Build graphs to compare traffic behavior
   - Graph application throughput and compare to overall link traffic
     seen
   - Identify applications that do not encrypt traffic
   - Play back VoIP conversations to hear the effects of various
     network problems on network traffic
   - Perform passive operating system and application use detection
   - Spot unusual protocols and unrecognized port number usage on the
     network
   - Examine the startup process of hosts and applications on the
     network
   - Identify average and unacceptable service response times (SRT)
   - Graph intervals of periodic packet generation applications or
     protocols

** 网络数据分析 

*** RTP Statistics
    [[./images/2016/2016070101.png]]
    
    - Jitter
    - Delta
      The delta is the time difference between the current packet and
      the previous packet in the stream. max delta is the largest
      delta value.

    - Skew
      Skew calculation is defined as follows (from:
      tap-rtp-common.c). max skew is the largest value of all skew
      values.
      #+BEGIN_SRC c
        /* Calculate skew, i.e. absolute jitter that also catches clock drift
         ,* Skew is positive if TS (nominal) is too fast
         ,*/
        statinfo->skew    = nominaltime - arrivaltime;
        absskew = fabs(statinfo->skew);
        if(absskew > fabs(statinfo->max_skew)){
          statinfo->max_skew = statinfo->skew;
         }      
      #+END_SRC
      
    - bandwidth
      The BW column in RTP Streams and RTP Statistics dialogs shows
      the bandwidth at IP level for the given RTP stream. It is the
      sum of all octets, including IP and UDP headers (20+8 bytes),
      from all the packets of the given RTP stream over the last
      second.

** Identify Network Problems
   
*** slow network communications
    Slow network performance can be due to high latency, access
    errors, excessive number of packets required to obtain data or a
    number of other causes. 

    When poor performance is due to *delays* in the communications, look
    for /large gaps in time/ between a request and acknowledgement, an
    acknowledgement and a response, etc.
