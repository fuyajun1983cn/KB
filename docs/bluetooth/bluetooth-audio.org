* Bluetooth Codecs

** Basic terms

   - *Sample rate (Hz)* 

     the number of points of data per second in an
     audio file. You need two samples to accurately capture any
     frequency, so audio is sampled at least twice the limits of human
     hearing (approximately 20 kHz). Higher resolution file formats
     tend to be exported at 96 kHz or greater. A greater sample rate
     means a greater file size.

   - *Bit-depth (-bit)*

     the number of bits saved for each audio sample. A higher bit
     depth records a signal more accurately. CD quality is 16-bits,
     but high resolution files extend this to 24-bits. A greater bit
     depth multiplies the file size.

   - *Bit-rate (kbps)*

     usually measured in kbps or mbps. This is the amount of audio
     data transferred per second over Bluetooth. For uncompressed
     files, this is calculated by multiplying the sample rate by the
     bit-depth.
     
** Audio Type

   There are three main types of audio compression formats,
   /uncompressed/, /lossless/, and /lossy/.

** Codecs

   High-quality audio is streamed more efficiently over codecs like
   aptX and LDAC than the popular, yet limited, SBC and AAC codecs.

   Google O release has support for new codecs like Aptx , Aptx-HD,
   AAC and LDAC.

   In terms of software, a codec determines how Bluetooth is
   transmitted from the source to your headphones. It encodes and
   decodes digital audio data into a specific format. Ideally, it
   transmits a high-fidelity signal at the minimum specified
   bit-rate. This results in the least amount of space and bandwidth
   required for storage and playback, respectively. A lower bitrate
   means better compression and worse sound quality, a high bitrate
   means better sound quality and worse compression.

   - low-complexity sub-band codec (SBC) 

     divides the signal into multiple frequency bands and encodes each
     one independently. Think of SBC as the lowest common denominator
     among Bluetooth codecs. It’s not the best. It is, however,
     mandatory among all A2DP-enabled devices, making it virtually
     universal. Manageable transfer rates (192-320 kbps) are delivered
     at the expense of significant data loss.

     Number of  PCM Samples in  one SBC frame per chhannel(N) =
     Num. of Subbands * Block Length.

     Sampling Freq(fs) = samples/sec.

     One sample is sampled in 1/fs secs.

     Per channel, 'N' samples are sampled in (T) = N/fs secs = 1000 *
     1000 x N/fs usecs 

     Since for stereo, 2 samples (L + R) are sampled in one sample clock only.
     So one sample is sampled 1/(fs*2) secs.
     For Stereo, 'N' samples (both L and R) are sampled in (T) =
     (2*N)/(fs*2) = N/fs sec = N*1000000/fs usecs

   - apt-X/apt-X HD

     The simpler apt-X codec supports 48 kHz / 16 bit LCPM audio data
     (352 kbps), while apt-X HD supports 48 kHz / 24 bit LCPM audio
     data (576 kbps). Though both are lossy formats, they’re leagues
     ahead of SBC. Plus, they support a fine enough bit-rate to keep
     everything running smoothly and sounding phenomenal.

     

   - Advanced audio coding (AAC)
     
     This is the audio standard for lossy digital audio
     compression. It also happens to be the license-free standard for
     YouTube, Sony’s PlayStation 3, and is preferred by Apple. It has
     a transfer rate cap of 250 kbps, creating a file similar to that
     of a mid-quality MP3.

   - LDAC

     Sony’s own proprietary Bluetooth codec. Its variable bit-rate is
     the defining feature, which transfers up to 3x the data compared
     to SBC. It’s able to maintain a sample rate and bit depth at 96
     kHz / 24 bit (maxed at 990 kbps).

     You may select 3 kinds of transmission rates; Quality priority
     mode, Normal mode and Connection priority mode.

     1. 990kbps: (Quality priority mode)

        3x the data transmitted compared to existing wireless
        technology

        *Bluetooth A2DP - SBC (328kbps, 44.1kHz)*

     2. 660kbps: (Normal mode）

        Initial setting mode of Walkman

     3. 330kbps: (Connection priority mode)

        Almost same as existing codec.

        *It achieves the higher sound quality than conventional codec,
        even in a bad connection environment.*

   - LHDC

     LHDC™ stands for low latency and high-definition audio codec and
     is announced by Savitech. Comparing to the Bluetooth SBC audio
     format, LHDC™ allows more than 3 times the data
     transmitted. LHDC™ provides the most realistic and high
     definition wireless audio. There will be no more audio quality
     disparity between wireless and wired audio devices. Enjoy both
     the convenience and high quality that wireless audio via
     Bluetooth brings.

     SBC：

     1. SBC codec transmits less volume of data

     2. SBC codec provides less sound quality

     LHDC :

     1. LHDC™ codec transmits more than 3 times the volume of data
        compared to other technologies

     2. Excellent sound quality that LHDC™ codec can provide

     3. The increase of data transmitted enables users to experience
        more details and a better sound field, and immerse in the
        emotion of the music

* Bluetooth audio streaming

  From portable speakers and car infotainment systems to earphones and
  hearing aids, the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) is by
  far the most common protocol for wireless audio streaming. As part
  of the Bluetooth classic protocol, A2DP is designed to
  unidirectionally transfer an audio stream in up to two-channel
  stereo from one device to another. 

  There are drawbacks for it. 

  1. The profile doesn’t handle true wireless stereo (TWS), meaning
     two non-wired devices serving as left and right speakers (like
     AirPods). A2DP sends the stream to one device, which then
     splits the channels to two speakers that are connected by a
     wire. Conversely, TWS requires two separate devices to receive
     the audio stream and emit each channel in perfect
     synchronization (otherwise the sound will be unbearable). This
     is an especially challenging problem when the two speakers are
     inside someone’s left and right ears, as the human head is a
     difficult barrier for BT’s 2.4-GHz waves. Various hearables,
     like the AirPods and Samsung Gear’s IconX, have proprietary
     solutions to this problem, but there’s no standard.

  2. The next challenge is supporting more than just left and right
     speakers. As everything is becoming wireless, so are home cinema
     speakers of the 5.1 and 7.1 variety, and other immersive sound
     systems. This requires streaming of more than the two channels
     that A2DP supports.

  3. Power consumption is another limitation of A2DP that many are
     trying to overcome. 


** BLE Audio

   Enhancements in Bluetooth 5, which was recently released by the
   Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), have increased the speed of
   BLE to up to 2 Mbits/s, so BLE already has part of the foundation
   for high-quality audio streaming. Work on this next-generation
   low-power audio spec is ongoing and will no doubt appear in a
   future release, along with a new profile. This profile will be
   suited for hearables and other tiny devices with limited battery
   size, as it could reduce the power consumption by up to 10X.

   The new profile will come with new codecs and processing
   requirements. Handling this will require a flexible, programmable
   signal processing solution to allow modifications and
   upgrades. Aside from that, there are significant technical
   challenges to making BLE audio streaming work. For instance, what
   makes Bluetooth low energy "low energy" is its low duty cycles. It
   gives devices only a little bit of data at a time, then shuts off
   to conserve power. Audio, however, streams
   continuously. Maintaining an efficient connection when there's no
   way for that connection to "sleep" is tricky. This focus on lower
   bandwidth could make it difficult to improve the quality of the
   audio itself.
