<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Sample rate (Hz)</b> 

<p>
the number of points of data per second in an
audio file. You need two samples to accurately capture any
frequency, so audio is sampled at least twice the limits of human
hearing (approximately 20 kHz). Higher resolution file formats
tend to be exported at 96 kHz or greater. A greater sample rate
means a greater file size.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Bit-depth (-bit)</b>

<p>
the number of bits saved for each audio sample. A higher bit
depth records a signal more accurately. CD quality is 16-bits,
but high resolution files extend this to 24-bits. A greater bit
depth multiplies the file size.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Bit-rate (kbps)</b>

<p>
usually measured in kbps or mbps. This is the amount of audio
data transferred per second over Bluetooth. For uncompressed
files, this is calculated by multiplying the sample rate by the
bit-depth.

There are three main types of audio compression formats,
<i>uncompressed</i>, <i>lossless</i>, and <i>lossy</i>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
High-quality audio is streamed more efficiently over codecs like
aptX and LDAC than the popular, yet limited, SBC and AAC codecs.
</p>

<p>
Google O release has support for new codecs like Aptx , Aptx-HD,
AAC and LDAC.
</p>

<p>
In terms of software, a codec determines how Bluetooth is
transmitted from the source to your headphones. It encodes and
decodes digital audio data into a specific format. Ideally, it
transmits a high-fidelity signal at the minimum specified
bit-rate. This results in the least amount of space and bandwidth
required for storage and playback, respectively. A lower bitrate
means better compression and worse sound quality, a high bitrate
means better sound quality and worse compression. 
</p>


<div class="figure">

</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>low-complexity sub-band codec (SBC) 

<p>
divides the signal into multiple frequency bands and encodes each
one independently. Think of SBC as the lowest common denominator
among Bluetooth codecs. It’s not the best. It is, however,
mandatory among all A2DP-enabled devices, making it virtually
universal. Manageable transfer rates (192-320 kbps) are delivered
at the expense of significant data loss.
</p>
</li>

<li>apt-X/apt-X HD

<p>
The simpler apt-X codec supports 48 kHz / 16 bit LCPM audio data
(352 kbps), while apt-X HD supports 48 kHz / 24 bit LCPM audio
data (576 kbps). Though both are lossy formats, they’re leagues
ahead of SBC. Plus, they support a fine enough bit-rate to keep
everything running smoothly and sounding phenomenal.
</p>
</li>

<li>Advanced audio coding (AAC)

<p>
This is the audio standard for lossy digital audio
compression. It also happens to be the license-free standard for
YouTube, Sony’s PlayStation 3, and is preferred by Apple. It has
a transfer rate cap of 250 kbps, creating a file similar to that
of a mid-quality MP3.
</p>
</li>

<li>LDAC

<p>
Sony’s own proprietary Bluetooth codec. Its variable bit-rate is
the defining feature, which transfers up to 3x the data compared
to SBC. It’s able to maintain a sample rate and bit depth at 96
kHz / 24 bit (maxed at 990 kbps).

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Bluetooth audio streaming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
From portable speakers and car infotainment systems to earphones and
hearing aids, the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) is by
far the most common protocol for wireless audio streaming. As part
of the Bluetooth classic protocol, A2DP is designed to
unidirectionally transfer an audio stream in up to two-channel
stereo from one device to another. 
</p>

<p>
There are drawbacks for it. 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The profile doesn’t handle true wireless stereo (TWS), meaning
two non-wired devices serving as left and right speakers (like
AirPods). A2DP sends the stream to one device, which then
splits the channels to two speakers that are connected by a
wire. Conversely, TWS requires two separate devices to receive
the audio stream and emit each channel in perfect
synchronization (otherwise the sound will be unbearable). This
is an especially challenging problem when the two speakers are
inside someone’s left and right ears, as the human head is a
difficult barrier for BT’s 2.4-GHz waves. Various hearables,
like the AirPods and Samsung Gear’s IconX, have proprietary
solutions to this problem, but there’s no standard.
</li>

<li>The next challenge is supporting more than just left and right
speakers. As everything is becoming wireless, so are home cinema
speakers of the 5.1 and 7.1 variety, and other immersive sound
systems. This requires streaming of more than the two channels
that A2DP supports.
</li>

<li>Power consumption is another limitation of A2DP that many are
trying to overcome. 
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> BLE Audio</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Enhancements in Bluetooth 5, which was recently released by the
Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), have increased the speed of
BLE to up to 2 Mbits/s, so BLE already has part of the foundation
for high-quality audio streaming. Work on this next-generation
low-power audio spec is ongoing and will no doubt appear in a
future release, along with a new profile. This profile will be
suited for hearables and other tiny devices with limited battery
size, as it could reduce the power consumption by up to 10X.
</p>

<p>
The new profile will come with new codecs and processing
requirements. Handling this will require a flexible, programmable
signal processing solution to allow modifications and
upgrades. Aside from that, there are significant technical
challenges to making BLE audio streaming work. For instance, what
makes Bluetooth low energy "low energy" is its low duty cycles. It
gives devices only a little bit of data at a time, then shuts off
to conserve power. Audio, however, streams
continuously. Maintaining an efficient connection when there's no
way for that connection to "sleep" is tricky. This focus on lower
bandwidth could make it difficult to improve the quality of the
audio itself.
