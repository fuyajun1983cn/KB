* Bluetooth Qualification Process

** General Description

   [[../images/2018/2018092001.png]]

   All Bluetooth products must be qualified, in order to

   - Verify conformance

   - Grant IP license

   - Logo and word mark usage rights

   - Promote interoperability


   Consists of three steps

   - Radio qualification
     + Controller Subsystem
   - Software qualification
     + Host Subsystem
   - End product listing
     + Controller Subsystem combined with Host Subsystem

** Radio Qualification

   - Verify the radio’s conformance to the Bluetoothspecification

   - Radio testing at Bluetooth Qualified Test Facility

     + AT4 wireless

     + SGS

     + UL

     + etc.

   - Obtaining QDID from Bluetooth SIG

   - Component or subsystem listing

** Software Qualification

   - Verify the Bluetooth stack’s conformance to Bluetooth
     specification

   - Protocol testing at a Bluetooth Qualified Test Facility (or
     Profile Tuning Suite, PTS)

     + RFCOMM

     + L2CAP

     + ATT

     + etc.

   - Profile testing at a Bluetooth Qualified Test Facility (or PTS)

     + SPP

     + A2DP

     + Proximity

     + etc.

   - Obtaining QDID from Bluetooth SIG

   - Component or Subsystem listing

** End Product Listing

   - Combining the Subsystems to an end product

   - End products can be sold as is without limitations of the
     Bluetooth license

   - End products represent a complete Bluetooth wireless solution

   - Typically a combination of two (or three) Subsystems:

     + A Bluetooth Controller Subsystem (radio and HCI)

     + A Bluetooth Host Subsystem (protocols and profiles)

     + Profile Subsystem (profiles)

   - End Product Listing process changed 1st of February 2014:

     + Qualification of Bluetooth products is still necessary –just
       like before

   - Multiple EPLs can however be made with a single fee as long as
     the Bluetooth components (hardware and software) remain the
     same.

* Bluetooth qualified designs

  There are three main categories in the Bluetooth qualification: End
  Products, Subsystems and Components. Subsystems and Components
  categories can be divided into subcategories.

  The picture below demonstrates different types of Bluetooth
  qualified design.

** End Product

   Every product sold in the market which has a functional
   implementation of the Bluetooth technology must be qualified as an
   End Product and listed in a directory of commercially available
   products maintained by the SIG. End Products may be independently
   functional Bluetooth devices, and for example Silicon Labs BGM111
   is qualified as an End Product. End Products are as such when they
   are based on pre-qualified Host and a Controller Subsystems at a
   minimum (in addition they may also include Subsystems related to
   Protocols/Services/Profiles) or when they are based on
   pre-qualified tested Components which are combined to cover the
   required layers for the independently functional Bluetooth device. 

** Subsystems

   There are three subcategories for Subsystems: Controller Subsystem,
   Host Subsystem and Profile Subsystem. 

   A Controller Subsystem must be eventually combined with a complementary Host Subsystem to
   create a complete Bluetooth core architecture required for
   operation. A Controller Subsystem may be for example an USB
   commercial Bluetooth Dongle containing the RF-PHY and Link layer
   implementations, normally below the standardized HCI software and
   hardware interface of the Bluetooth stack. 

   A Host Subsystem must be eventually combined with a complementary
   Controller Subsystem. A Host Subsystem may be for example the
   Bluetooth stack and application software running in an Operating
   System, provided by the OS itself or by a third-party. Profile
   Subsystem must eventually be combined with a complementary End
   Product or Host Subsystem and may be for example a product
   enhancement application implementing one or more of the adopted
   Bluetooth profiles.  

   A Profile Subsystem is not mandatory for obtaining an End Product 
   Listing, but might be used to ensure and demonstrate the
   compatibility to an adopted profile.

** Components

   Qualified Component designs do not have minimum layer support. They
   can be made of any layer or combination of layers. Component(s)
   combined together or with Subsystem(s) are the necessary parts to
   create a new End Product or Subsystem qualified design. Qualified
   Components are usually specific layers for example Silicon Labs
   RF-PHY layer. These qualified layers can be used in a design and
   re-performing tests are not needed.
