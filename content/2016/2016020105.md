**Category** – Describes the action frame type. Here are the different category type of Action frames (per 802.11-2007 standard where current CWAP exam is based on)  
0 – Spectrum Management  
 1 : QoS   
 2 : DLS   
 3 : Block ACK  
 4 : Public  
 5 : Radio Measurement  
 6 : Fast BSS Transistion  
 7 : High Throughput (HT)   
 8 : SA Query   
 9 : Protected dual of public action  
 10-125 : Reserved/Unused   
 126 : Vendor specific protected   
 127 : Vendor specific   
 128-255: Error   

 **Action** – The action to perform, it is usually a number represent different actions  
 **Element**– Adds additional information specific to the action  

 Here are few example for captures of Action Frames. For the [full list of action frame code values](11-10-0097-06-00ae-management-frame-analysis.xls) refer table 4.10 of CWAP Official Study Guide (page 165-168). If you want to know more information including other type of action frames refer IEEE 802.11-2012 section 8.5 (page 726- 812). Here is a brief description of selected type of action frame category.  

  You can filter Action Frames in wireshark using below filter (management frames with subtype value 13 ).  

  ```
  (wlan.fc.type == 0)&&(wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0d)
  ```

1. Spectrum Management (Category 0)   

 0 : Measurement Request  
 1 : Measurement Report
