 Title: CWAP- 802.11 Data- Frame Aggregation
 Sort: 2
 */
 
KEYWORDS: data frame

With the ratification of 802.11n amendment, two types of frame aggregation were added to 802.11  
1. Aggregate MAC Service Data Unit (A-MSDU)  
2. Aggregate MAC Protocol Data Unit (A-MPDU)  

Frame aggregation allows multiple smaller MSDU or MPDUs to be grouped together into a single frame, reducing the amount of overhead that would have been necessary for each individual frame.  

An A-MSDU is a sequence of A-MSDU subframes as shown below. Each A-MSDU subframe consists of an A-MSDU subframe header followed by an MSDU and 0 to 3 octets of padding. Each A-MSDU subframe (except the last) is padded so that its length is a multiple of 4 octets. The last A-MSDU subframe has no padding.

**A-MSDU Operation**   
- If encryption is enabled, then all MSDU are encrypted together as a single payload.  
- An A-MSDU shall contain only MSDUs whose DA and SA parameter values map to the same RA and TA values.  
- The constituent MSDUs of an A-MSDU shall all have the same priority parameter value.  
- An A-MSDU shall be carried, without fragmentation, within a single QoS data MPDU.  
- The Address 1 field of an MPDU carrying an A-MSDU shall be set to an individual address.  
- The channel access rules for a QoS data MPDU carrying an A-MSDU are the same as a data MPDU carrying an MSDU (or fragment thereof) of the same TID.  

Below diagram (CWAP Study Guide â€“ Page 225) show the A-MSDU Aggregation

The maximum MPDU length that can be transported using A-MPDU aggregation is 4095 octets. An A-MSDU cannot be fragmented. Therefore, an A-MSDU of a length that exceeds 4065 octets (4095 minus the QoS data MPDU overhead) cannot be transported in an A-MPDU.  

**A-MPDU Operation**  
- If encryption enabled, then each MPDU is encrypted individually.  
- The individual MPDU within an A-MPDU must all have same receiver address.  
- The individual MPDU must all be of the same 802.11e QoS access category.  
- A-MPDU also require the use of Block Ack.  
- The Duration/ID fields in the MAC headers of all MPDUs in an A-MPDU carry the same value.  
- All protected MPDUs within an A-MPDU have the same Key ID.
