KEYWORDS: 802.11 address

802.11 MAC sublayer address is one of the following two types  
1. Individual Address (known as unicast address)  
2. Group Address (Multicast or Broadcast address)   

802.11 frame can have upto 4 address fields in the MAC header. 802.11
frames typically use only 3 of the MAC address fields, but frames send
within WDS (Wireless Distribution System) requires all 4 MAC address
fields. Content of those address fields could includes following.

1. Receiver Address (RA)  
2. Transmitter Address (TA)  
3. Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID)  
4. Destination Address (DA)   
5. Source Address (SA)  

Depending on how the “To DS” & “From DS” fields are used, the
definition of each address fields of 4 MAC address fields will
change. This will summarize in below diagram (CWAP Study Guide – Page
92)

Let’s take a look at each scenario with details to understand this
better. I have used a 3850 (WLC) connected AP (3702-2) & use iPhone5
as client.

![12](%image_url%/2016/2016011812.png)

You can get client & BSSID information using CLI as shown below.

```
3850-1#show wireless client summary 
Number of Local Clients : 1
MAC Address    AP Name                          WLAN State              Protocol 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
04f7.e4ea.5b66 3702-2                           21   UP                 11n(5) 

3850-1#show wireless client mac-address 04f7.e4ea.5b66 detail | in MAC|BSSID
Client MAC Address : 04f7.e4ea.5b66
AP MAC Address : b838.6199.1aa0 <- Radio1 Base AP MAC address
BSSID : b838.6199.1aaf 
```

To DS=0 , From DS=0  
One of the scenario for “To DS”=0 & “From DS”=0 is either control
frame or management frame. Since those frame does not go to DS, both
bits set to 0. In this case addressing values should be like this.

Address 1: RA=DA (Receiver Address= Destination Address)  
Address 2: TA=SA (Transmitter Address= Source Address)  
Address 3: BSSID  

Here is a Association Request frame coming from Client station to
AP. As you can see below addressing fields content in captured
wireless frame.

Address 1= RA/DA-b8:38:61:99:1a:af (AP Radio MAC for given SSID)   
Address 2= TA/SA-04:f7:e4:ea:5b:66 (iPhone5 802.11 MAC)   
Address 3= b8:38:61:99:1a:af (BSSID)

To DS=0, From DS=1  
This may be a frame coming from wired system to wireless client. I
have generate an ICMP ping from wired PC (192.168.20.64) to wireless
client(192.168.21.68) to simulate a traffic flow.  

Address 1: RA=DA (Receiver Address= Destination Address)  
Address 2: TA=BSSID (Transmitter Address= Basic Service Set
Identifier)  
Address 3: SA (Source Address)  

In my case since traffic is coming from 192.168.20.64 to
192.168.21.68, 3850 switch change source of the L2 frame to vlan21 MAC
address (gateway for vlan 21) when it send frames to client in
vlan 21. Therefore 3 addresses fields content looks like this

Address 1: RA=DA – 04:f7:e4:ea:5b:66 (iPhone5 802.11 MAC)  
Address 2: TA=BSSID – b8:38:61:99:1a:af  
Address 3: SA – 58:bf:ea:b6:56:e8 (vlan 21 gateway MAC in 3850)

To DS=1, From DS=0  
In this scenario traffic is going from wireless client to wired side
(To DS=1). So addressing fields consist following information.

Address 1: RA=BSSID (Receiver Address=Basic Service Set Identifier)  
Address 2: TA=SA (Transmitter Address= Source Address)  
Address 3: DA (Destination Address)  

I have taken ICMP echo response going from wireless client as sample
frame. In this case as well Destination Address set to vlan21 MAC
address.

Address 1: RA=BSSID – b8:38:61:99:1a:af  
Address 2: TA=SA – 04:f7:e4:ea:5b:66 (iPhone5 802.11 MAC)  
Address 3: DA – 58:8f:ea:b6:56:e8 (vlan 21 gateway MAC in 3850)  

![15](%image_url%/2016/2016011815.png)

To DS=1, From DS=1  
In situations where WDS – Wireless Distribution System (eg Bridges,
Mesh AP, Repeaters) in use, all 4 address fields used. So address
fields should be like this.


Address 1: RA (Receiver Address)  
Address 2: TA (Transmitter Address)  
Address 3: DA (Destination Address)  
Address 3: SA (Source Address)  

I have taken wireless capture when 7965 communicating with 7921 across
a wireless bridge shown in the below.

![16](%image_url%/2016/2016011816.png)

Here is a data frame capture for a packet going from 7965
(192.168.2.5) to 7921 (192.168.140.83) wireless phone. Address field
information is like this.

Address 1: RA – a4:0c:c3:1a:ee:60 (AAP1 802.11 BSSID for SSID-MGMT)  
Address 2: TA – 64:ae:0c:93:75:90 (AAP2 802.11 BSSID for SSID-MGMT)  
Address 3: DA – 00:1a:e3:a7:ff:40 (vlan 2 gateway MAC in C3750)  
Address 4: SA – c8:f9:f9:d7:3b:a7 (7965 MAC address)
