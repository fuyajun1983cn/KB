KEYWORDS: 802.11 帧控制

As shown in the below figure, 802.11 MAC header has 9 major fields  
![01](%image_url%/2016/2016011801.png)

- 2 Byte – Frame Control
- 2 Byte – Duration/ID
- 4×6 Byte – Address 1 – 4
- 2 Byte – Sequence Control
- 2 Byte – QoS control
- 4 Byte – HT Control (only for 802.11n frames)

Therefore max size of MAC header would be 36 bytes (802.11n) & 32
bytes (802.11a/b/g). Below show a sample wireless frame & highlighted
the major fields of MAC header. As you can see this frame uses only 3
Address fields (Not every frame uses all 4 address fields, this is
used when DS to DS frame exchange like in wireless bridge ).

![02](%image_url%/2016/2016011802.png)

Here is an ACK frame. As you can see it only use 1 Address field. Also
it does not have Sequency or QoS control fields (QoS control field
available only on QoS Data frames)

As you can see above all wireless frames does not have same size MAC
headers. Let’s  see “Frame Control” information in detail. As you can
see below it contain 11 subfields within “Frame Control” field.

![04](%image_url%/2016/2016011804.png)

1. Protocol Version (2-bits)  
   This field is simply used to indicate which protocol version of
   802.11 is being used by the frame. This is always set to “0” as
   currently one version of 802.11 technology exist.

2. Type (2-bits)  
   There are 3 types (Management, Control, Data) of wireless frames
   defined in the standard.  Below shows the bit value of “Type” field
   respect to each different type of frames.
   
   00– Management Frame  
   01– Control Frame  
   10– Data Frame  
   11– Reserved

3. Subtype (4-bits)  
   There are many different kinds of management, control & data
   frames. Therefore 4-bit Subtype field is required to differentiate
   them. Here are few examples of different subtypes (CWAP Official
   Study Guide – Page 79)

4. To DS (1-bit)  
   When it set to “1” that indicate data frame is going from client
   station (STA) to Distribution System (DS) 

5. From DS (1-bit)  
   When it set to “1” that indicate data frame is going from
   Distribution System (DS) to client station (STA)

   Also this To DS & From DS field combination (00, 01,10 & 11)
   indication different scenarios 

   **To DS=0, From DS=0**  
   – It can be management or control frames where it does not go to DS  
   – Station to Station communication in IBSS  
   – STSL: Station to Station Link where data frame exchange direct client to client.  
   **To DS=0, From DS=1**  
   – Downstream traffic from AP to a client station.  
   **To DS=1, From DS=0**  
   – Upstream traffic from a client station to an AP.  
   **To DS=1, From DS=1**  
   Data frames uses four address format.Usually occurs when Wireless
   Distribution System (WDS) in use, like Wireless Bridge or Mesh
   Network.
   
6. More Fragments (1-bit)   
   If this bit is set to “1” that indicate thta frame (data or
   management type) have another fragment of the current MSDU or
   current MMPDU to follow. MAC layer fragments only those frame
   having unicast receiver address & never fragments broadcast or
   multicast frames (as those never get acknowledged)
   
7. Retry (1-bit)   
   If Retry bit set to “1”  in either a management frame or data
   frame, the Tx radio is indicating that the frame being sent is a
   “retransmission”. If a Tx station did not receive an ACK for a
   unicast frame, then frame will be retransmitted. In certain cases
   where ACK is not used (eg in RTS/CTS frame exchange, CTS server as
   ACK). Excessive L2 retransmissions affect WLAN performance in two
   ways.
   
   - Increases overhead resulting decreasing throughput
   - impact timely delivery of application traffic (affect voice/video
     services
     
   Typically most data applications operate in environment upto 10%
   retransmissions without any noticeable degradation in
   performance. However time sensitive applications like VoIP required
   less than 5% retransmissions. Using a wireless protocol analyzer
   you can see retransmissions rate in a given environment (below
   taken from OmniPeek Analyzer)

8. Power Management (1-bit)  
   When a client station in “Power Save mode” it will shutdown some of
   the transceivers components for a period of time to conserve
   power.The station indicates that it is using Power Save mode by
   changing the value of Power Save mode bit to 1. As you can see
   below “Null ” data frames used to inform AP about client in Power
   Save mode.

9. More Data (1-bit)   
   When a client associate to an AP, client receives an association
   identifier (AID). AP use this AID to keep track of stations
   associated to the AP & members of BSS. If AP is buffering data for
   a station in Power Save mode, when AP transmit its next beacon, the
   AID of the station will be seen in a field called “traffic
   indication map– TIM“. When station receives the beacon during the
   awake state, it checks to see wether its AID is set in TIM,
   indicating buffered unicast frame waits. If so station will remain
   awake & will send a PS-Poll frame to the AP. Then AP will send
   buffered unicast frame to station. To indicate there are more
   frames AP will set “More Data” field to 1, so station can awake to
   receive all of those frames. Below diagram (page 85 – CWAP study
   guide) summarize this process

10. Protected Frame (1-bit)  
   This field is used to indicate whether the MSDU payload of a data
   frame is encrypted.Below shows a Data frame where payload is
   encrypted indicated by setting protected bit to “1”. When client
   informed AP that it is on Power Save mode, then AP buffer all that
   client’s 802.11 frames.

   It can be 1 in management frame type authentication when it used
   shared key authentication. Below shows the 3rd authentication frame
   used in that exchange where cleartext is encrypted using WEP (see
   this post for more detail)

11. Order (1-bit)  
   If it set to “1” in any non-QoS data frame when a higher layer has
   requested that the data be sent using a strictly ordered class of
   service, which tells the receiving station the frames must be
   processed in order. This field is set to “0” in all other frames.
