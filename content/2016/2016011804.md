KEYWORDS: 802.11 Duration ID

Duration/ID field is 2 bytes(16bits) long field in the 802.11 MAC header.

Here is the 16 bit of Duration/ID field

In 802.11, Duration/ID field can be used for 3 different reason  
1. Virtual Carrier Sense – This is the main purpose which used to reset the NAV timer of the other stations  
2. Legacy Power Management – PS Poll frames use this field as an association identifer (AID)  
3. Contention-free Period – This field is used as an indicator that a point coordination function (PCF) process has begun.  

**Virtual Carrier Sense**  
– Virtual Carrier Sense use a timer mechanism known as the NAV
  (Network Allocation Vector)  
– When listening STA hears a frame transmission by other STA, the
  listening STA will set its NAV timer to the value appear in
  transmitted frame.  
– listening STA then will use the NAV as a count down timer, knowing
  that RF medium will be busy until it reach 0.  
– When a client transmit a unicast frame, Duration/ID field use bit
  0-14 (value 0 – 32767)  
– Duration/ID value represent time in μS (microseconds) that is
  required to transmit the ACK + one SIFS interval.  
– Duration values are always about frame transmission that are to
  follow.  
– The client who transmit a frame will calculate how long it will take
  to receive an ACK frame & include that in the duration field.  
– The ACK frame follows the transmitted frame having duration value
  of 0.  
  
Below shows a frame capture of a unicast frame & ACK followed by the
transmission. As you can see duration value of 44 μS (time for a
ACK+SIFS) for tx frame & ACK having 0 μS value.

When this type of frame is transmitting in the RF all other receiving
STA set their NAV to 44 μS

– NAV is not updated when the receiver address (RA) is the same as
  receiving station’s MAC address.  
– Duration value of the Tx STA does not reset the trasmitter’s NAV
  timer (as it cannot hear its own tx)  
– Transmitter NAV will be zero after transmitting

**PS-Poll in Legacy Power Management**  
– When a STA associate to an AP each STA will get a unique AID
  (Association Identifier) 
– If AP buffering  data for a station in power save mode, when AP
  transmit its next beacon, the AID of station will be seen in TIM
  (Traffic Indicator Map)  
– TIM field is a list of all stations that have undelivered unicast
  data buffered on the AP (DTIM is used for multicast buffered data)  
– Client will send a PS-Poll frame to request that AP sends the
  unicast buffered frame to the STA.  
– In PS-Poll frame Duration/ID field use as an identifier (AID) &  not
  being used for duration or resetting NAV timers.  
– When it use in PS-Poll frame, tow Most Significant Bits (MSB) set to
  1 & AID value use rest of the 14 LSB(Least Significant Bits).  
– But allowable value for AID is 1 – 2007.

Below shows a PS-Poll frame capture that shows the AID value (3 in my
case) instead of Duration value.

**Contention-free period in PCF**  
– When duration field used in PCF, it used a fixed value of 32768 (bit
  15 is 1 & all other bits set to 0)  
– In all frames transmitted in Contention-free Period (CFP) have
  duration value of 32768.  
– In HCF (Hybrid Coordination Function) Channel Access (HCCA) that
  require to use CFP.  
– None of the vendors not implemented HCCA

Below table summarize the  duration ID field contents & highlighted
the 3 main scenarios explained above (source page 90-91 CWAP study
guide)
