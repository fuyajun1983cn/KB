 Title: CWAP â€“ Reassociation Req/Response
 Sort: 2
 */
 
**Reassociation Request frame sent only by a STA to an AP & used when the STA already associated to the ESS & want to associate to another AP connecting to the same ESS**. This frame can also be used if the STA left the cell for a short duration & want to rejoin the cell again.

We will use the below topology to look into Reassociation Request/Response frames detail. In this post we will not discuss 802.11r process in detail & refer this post  if you require more on that.

If you capture wireless frames on CH149, you should see the Reassociation Request & Response frame exchange as shown below.

Frame format of a Reassociation Request frame is shown below.

When STA move from LAP2 to 3702-2 AP cell area, you will  noticed STA roamed to 3702-2 AP. To initiate this process STA will send a  Reassociation Request frame to the 3702-2.  

Here is the Reassociation Request send by iPhone5. It is a management frame with subtype 2. Note that it will list the Current AP Address (LAP2- B8:38:61:99:1A:AE) STA is associated to.  **STA can be associated to ONE AP at any given time where as it can be authenticated to multiple AP**. Note that FTE & MDIE information element is there because BSS is configured for 802.11r FT.

Here is the list of information contain in the frame body of a Reassociation Request frame (source IEEE 802.11-2012)

Once AP received the Reassociation Request will acknowledge that by sending an ACK.

Then AP will respond with **Reassociation Response** frame. **It is a management frame with subtype 3**. Depend on the information provided in Reassociation Request, AP may or may not be allow STA to join. In given scenario status code=0 implies a successful reassociation & AID is given for the client (AID=1 in my case).

Here is the complete list of information that can be in the frame body of Reassociation Response frame. (source IEEE 802.11-2012)

Finally client STA will send an ACK for the Reassociation Response frame.
