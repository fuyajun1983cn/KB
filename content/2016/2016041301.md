 Title: CWSP – 4 Way Handshake
 Sort: 2
 */

KEYWORDS: wifi 802.11

In this post we will go through 4-Way Handshake process. This is described in Chapter 5 of CWSP Official Study Guide. Page 194 of this book shows the below RSN key hierarchy.

## MSK-Master Session Key ( or AAA Key):
Key information that is jointly negotiated between the Supplicant & Authentication Server. This key information is transported via a secure channel from Authenticating Server to Authenticator.

## PMK-Pairwise Master Key:
PMK is derived from MSK seeding material. PMK is first 256bits (0-255) of MSK. It can be derived from an EAP method or directly from a PresharedKey(PSK).

## GMK-Group Master Key:
GMK is randomly created on Authenticator & refresh it in configured time interval to reduce the risk of GMK being compromised.

## PTK-Pairwise Transient Key:
A value derived from PMK,Authenicator nonce(Anonce),Supplicant nonce(Snonce), Authenticator Address, Supplicant Address. This is used to encrypt all unicast transmission between client & an AP. PTK consist of 5 different keys
1. KCK-Key Confirmation Key-used to provide data integrity during 4 -Way Handshake & Group Key Handshake.   
2. KEK – Key Encryption Key– used by EAPOL-Key frames to provide data privacy during 4-Way Handshake & Group Key Handshake.   
3. Temporal Key – used to encrypt & decrypt MSDU of 802.11 data frames between supplicant & authenticator   
4. Temporal MIC-1   
5. Temporal MIC-2

## GTK-Group Temporal Key:
GTK is used to encrypt all broadcast/multicast transmission between an AP & multiple client statsions. GTK is derived on Authenticator & sending to supplicant during 4-Way Handshake (M3)

4-Way handshake utilizing EAPOL-Key frames initiated by the Authenticator to do the following.    
1. Confirm that live peer holds PMK   
2. Confirm that PMK is current.    
3. Derive a fresh PTK from PMK & Install the pairwise encryption & integrity keys into 802.11    
4. Transport the GTK & GTK sequence number from Authenticator to Supplicant & install them in Supplicant & AP(if not already installed)    
5. Confirm cipher suite selection.

If it is PSK,  4 way handshak starts immediately after Open System Authentication & Association state finish as you can see below.

If it is 802.1X/EAP, then 4 way handshake starts when EAP Authentication finished.

Below figure shows the steps involved in 4-Way handshake process.

Here is the details about each step. You can filter EAPOL-Key messages using `“eapol.keydes.type == 2”` wireshark display filter.

## Message 1 (M1)
* Authenticator sends EAPOL-Key frame containing an ANonce(Authenticator nonce) to supplicant.    
* With this information, supplicant have all  necessary input to generate PTK using pseudo-random function(PRF)

## Message 2 (M2)
* Supplicant sends an EAPOL-Key frame containing SNonce to the Authenticator.    
* Now authenticator has all the inputs to create PTK.   
* Supplicant also sent RSN IE capabilities to Authenticator & MIC    
* Authenticator derive PTK & validate the MIC as well.

## Message 3 (M3)
* If necessary, Authenticator will derive GTK from GMK.   
* Authenticator sends EAPOL-Key frame containing ANonce, RSN-IE & a MIC.    
* GTK will be delivered (encrypted with PTK) to supplicant.    
* Message to supplicant to install temporal keys.

## Message 4 (M4)
* Supplicant sends final EAPOL-Key frame to authenticator to confirm temporal keys have been installed.

From this point onwards data frame MSDU will be encrypted using PTK or GTK (depending upon unicast or multicast/broadcast frame)
