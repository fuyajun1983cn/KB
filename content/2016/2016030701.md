## An extension for Chrome typically consists of the following things:  
1. A manifest (a required file with metadata)  
>The manifest is a JSON-formatted file which contains data crucial to the application ranging from things such as the name, description, icons, and the author of the extension to data defining the needs of the extension – which websites should the extension be able to run on (those would be the permissions which the user must grant) or what files to run when the user is browsing a particular website.  
2. Images (such as the extension’s icon)  
>You can provide numerous icons that respond to different sizes in the `icons` object.
3. HTML files (such as a popup that will be shown when the users click on the extension’s icon)  
4. JavaScript files (such as content and/or background scripts which will be explained in a bit)  
>`Background scripts` are scripts which are long-running and will continue to run until the user’s browser is closed or the extension is disabled.
>`Content scripts`, unlike background scripts, have access to the DOM of the actual website which the user is visiting. Content scripts can both read and make modifications to the DOM of any webpage that they are embedded in.   
5. Any other asset that may be used by your application (such as a stylesheet)
