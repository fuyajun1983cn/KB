## An extension for Chrome typically consists of the following things:  
1. A manifest (a required file with metadata)  
2. Images (such as the extension’s icon)  
3. HTML files (such as a popup that will be shown when the users click on the extension’s icon)  
4. JavaScript files (such as content and/or background scripts which will be explained in a bit)  
5. Any other asset that may be used by your application (such as a stylesheet)
