## General Description   

- *Interop_modue* is a part of Bluedroid stack. This module is used to maintain blacklist devices database.

- This module provides interface for adding dynamic entries to the interop workaround database

- The main purpose of this module to maintain all blacklist database entries in a single configuration file.

## Current Design

- As per current design, `Interop_module` will maintain blacklist entries in persistent location.  It will maintain all entries in a single configuration file ( i.e.  interop_database.conf). 

- In BT turning on procedure,  Interop module will loads all entries from `interop_database.conf` file to `dynamic interop_list`. Both `interop_database.conf` and `dynamic interop_list` are in sync.

- User can edit and add dynamic blacklist entries to the conf file.

- Below are the different API’s provided by interop module to add/remove/match to interop list, These API’s can be called from other layers.

  - `interop_database_match_addr` :  It checks for the given blacklist device address in the interop_list.

  - `interop_database_remove_addr` :  It removes the device address from interop_list as well as from persist database ( i.e.  interop_database.conf).

  - `interop_database_add_addr` :  It will adds the device address to interop_list as well as to  persist database ( i.e.  interop_database.conf).


## Previous Design

- As per previous design, `Interop_modue` is maintaining only static database/entries for different blacklist types. Only we have dynamic database for Address Based blacklist devices.

- Blacklist devices entries are maintained as static array list in `interop_database.h` file and dynamic interop database in `interop_list` linked list for Addressed Based.

- Interoperability Module API’s:

  - This module provides one API for adding address based blacklist entries to the dynamic database. 

  - API’s to match entries with the static interop database.


### Limitation in previous module

- Although dynamic list is maintain at runtime, but these list is not persistent. Once BT is turn off then there is no way to have access to the same.

- There is no API to delete/remove entry from dynamic list. 

- As mentioned earlier, this module maintains dynamic list for only Addressed based blacklist.
