## MediaController

Allows an app to interact with an ongoing media session. Media buttons and other commands can be sent to the session. A callback may be registered to receive updates from the session, such as metadata and play state changes. 


## MediaSession

Allows interaction with media controllers, volume keys, media buttons, and transport controls.

A MediaSession should be created when an app wants to publish media playback information or handle media keys. In general an app only needs one session for all playback, though multiple sessions can be created to provide finer grain controls of media.

Once a session is created the owner of the session may pass its session token to other processes to allow them to create a MediaController to interact with the session.

To receive commands, media keys, and other events a MediaSession.Callback must be set with setCallback(Callback) and setActive(true) must be called.

When an app is finished performing playback it must call release() to clean up the session and notify any controllers.

MediaSession objects are thread safe.



## MediaSessionManager

  notify the active media session change info. 
Provides support for interacting with media sessions that applications have published to express their ongoing media playback state.

MediaSessionManager.OnActiveSessionsChangedListener

Add a listener to be notified when the list of active sessions changes.This requires the android.Manifest.permission.MEDIA_CONTENT_CONTROL permission be held by the calling app. You may also retrieve this list if your app is an enabled notification listener using the NotificationListenerService APIs, in which case you must pass the ComponentName of your enabled listener. Updates will be posted to the thread that registered the listener.



## Understanding MediaSession

### What does MediaSession do?

`MediaSession` does the following things:

- **Playback Control** —  It provides a single interface to control playback (eg: play, pause, stop, skip to next, play for search) that can be used by your app’s UI and external actors (eg: media buttons, Google Assistant). This might seem confusing at first, but if you bypass the MediaSession and directly control your player, then your app’s UI can easily go out of sync with the player and session when outside actors change playback state, or load different media.

- **State Sync** — It broadcasts the current playback state (playing, paused, stopped, etc) and media metadata (album art, song duration, song title, etc) to all outside actors, and your app itself.


### App that plays video in the foreground

The diagram below provides a high level overview of the components that you have to implement in order to create an audio playback app that uses `MediaSession`

![02](%image_url%/2018/2018012702.png)

You will have to perform the following tasks:

- Create a `MediaPlayer` or `ExoPlayer` to actually load, prepare, and play the content.

- Create a `MediaSession` that you can use to share information about what is playing to other apps. And you can also allow external playback control of your app (from Google Assistant, Bluetooth headsets, media buttons, etc).


### App that plays audio in the background

The diagram below provides a high level overview of all the different components that you have to implement in order to create an audio playback app that uses `MediaSession` and `MediaBrowserService` to play audio in the background.

At a high level you will have to:

- **Service** — Create a Service that manages the player and handles preparing and playing media. Create `MediaStyle` notifications that are tied to this service. This service needs to extend `MediaBrowserService` in order to provide content (eg: this is how Android Auto can browse the content provided by the app). The details for the service are provided in the sections below.

- **Client** — Create an `Activity` or `Fragment` that connects to this service using `MediaBrowser`. `MediaBrowser` allows access to the content provided by the `Service`, and allows the use of `MediaSession` to control playback and get updates on what media is loaded and the playback state changes (which actually occur in your Service). The details for the client are provided in the sections below.


**Service code**

The following diagram takes a closer look at the `Service` that you will need to have in your app that manages your player (`MediaPlayer` or `ExoPlayer`), and to create the `MediaSession` and keep it up to date with your player’s state changes. At a high level you will have to:

- In `onCreate()` you have to create a `MediaSession` and get it’s token.

- Pass this token to the `MediaBrowserService` by calling `setSessionToken`, and this will connect the `MediaBrowserService` to the `MediaSession`, and will allow the `MediaBrowser` (client to work with the `MediaSession`).

- The most important callback to implement is `MediaSession.Callback`. This callback is what allows transport controls to invoke play, stop, pause, etc actions on the callback, which are then used to play, stop, pause the underlying player.

- You will have to extend the `MediaBrowserService` and implement two methods in order to expose the catalog of media content that you are making browsable — `onGetRoot()` and `onLoadChildren()`.

Note: If you don’t need your content to be browsed by Android Auto, or other apps outside of your app’s UI, then you are safe to remove `MediaBrowserService` in your Service (and `MediaBrowser` in your client code). In this case, just by using `MediaSession`, you are getting all the benefits of allowing other apps to control playback and report state changes, without the ability to browse content in your app from outside your app’s UI.


**Activity / Client / UI code**

The following diagram takes a closer look at the client side code that you will need to have in your app in order to integrate with `MediaSession` and `MediaBrowser`. At a high level you will have to:

- In the `onStart()` method of your Activity, use a `MediaBrowser` to connect to the `Service`. This will allow you to get content that you can browse in the UI of your app, and playback using the `TransportControls` you get from the `MediaSession`’s `MediaController`. Note that you have to get the `MediaSession` token from the `MediaBrowser`, in order to correctly connect your `TransportControls` to the `MediaSession`.

- You have to implement three callbacks in your Activity.

- `MediaController.Callback` — this is used to update the of your app with the current playback state, and what media is currently loaded.

- `MediaBrowser.ConnectionCallback` — this is used to get the `MediaController` using the `MediaBrowser`’s `MediaSession` token. You can then get the `TransportControls` that you will use to actually initiate playback, pause, stop, skip, etc.

- `MediaBrowser.SubscriptionCallback` — this is used to update your UI so that you can show the user content (from the Service) that they can browse for playback.
