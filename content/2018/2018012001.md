## Description

1.	What conditions may trigger host send sniff sub-rating command? How does the host set parameters? Is the 1200 latency the default value and not change?

The short answer is host only set sniff subrate parameters, and it’s SoC which will negotiate with the remote device to go to sniff subrate mode further.  When sniff mode is initiated by our DUT,  this latency is by default 1200 slots for most of profiles. 


2.	How to tell if link is in sniff subrating mode?


When host send sniff subrate mode, the link doesn’t enter sniff subrating.
Only when controller send sniff subrating mode event, it means the link enters sniff subrating mode.
Here is the event:

3.	The conditions of enter sniff subrating mode, assuming initiated by DUT:

1)	Host sent sniff subrating command to set SSR parameters;

    If the sniff subrating max latency is not bigger than 2 times of sniff interval, link will not enter sniff subrating mode.

2)	Link is in sniff mode;

3)	Link has no data for some time (sniff interval)

4)	DUT and remote device both agree to enter sniff subrating mode, which means LMP_Sniff_Sub-rate_Req and LMP_Sniff_Sub-rate_Res transactions are successful.

4.	Sniff parameter

If sniff is initiated by remote, controller just accept it.


## Code flow in bluedroid

Each profile will register with BT Power manager module during profile connection. Each profile has default set sniff idle time out and other sniff parameters based on the *bta_dm_pm_cfg*.

I just referred AG module configuration for example.  For AG module,  the spec index is 0 in spec table *bta_dm_pm_spec*.

When AG module idle, 7 sec idle timer triggered. Once idle Timer expired stack triggers sniff.

If more than 1 profile connected on same ACL, then least time out of all connected profiles will be effective.


Also, the SSR entry is BTA_DM_PM_SSR2, which means that the max latency is 1200 slots.

These ssr parameters also depends on profile. Each profile set ssr parameter based on config table we referred earlier.

For most profile connection, when in SSR, the max latency is `1200 * 0.625 = 750ms`. Only HID profile will use different ssr parameter. When DUT  moves back to active mode from any other low power mode, DUT update ssr parameters to soc.


SOC will use these sniff sub rating parameters in sniff mode.

When sys connection is idle(BTA_SYS_CONN_IDLE),  it will call *bta_dm_pm_cback*  to set SSR parameter.

![05](%image_url%/2018/2018012005.png)

Then call bta_dm_pm_set_mode to start timer for entering sniff mode. 
When the timer timeout, it will call bta_dm_pm_set_mode again to enter into Sniff Mode. 


When go to sniff mode,  host will send the following parameters to the SoC:

 - Sniff Max Interval
 
 - Sniff Min Interval
 
 - Sniff Attempts
 
 - Sniff Timeout


Those parameters are defined in *bta_dm_pm_md*.

For example, A2DP, we have the following default parameter settings:

![06](%image_url%/2018/2018012006.png)


![07](%image_url%/2018/2018012007.png)

```
Sniff max interval =  800 *0.625 = 500ms
Sniff min interval = 400 *0.625 =  250ms 
```

Most of the profile use BTA_DM_PM_SSR2 hence you might be SSR max latency will be `1200 * 0.625 = 750ms`. Only HID profile will use different ssr parameter

When DUT  moves back to active mode from any other low power mode, DUT update ssr parameters to soc.

SOC will use these sniff sub rating parameters in sniff mode.
