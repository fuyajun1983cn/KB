KEYWORDS: android

Android "init" can do a lot of things, including "on property change" trigger; one can image some applications use this to implement an ad-hoc IPC. One example is the `system/libnetutil` that monitors the "init.svc.dhcpcd" property to detect whether dhcpcd is running or not.

Android framework can execute some predefined command (service) via the "ctl.start" property, the most interesting part is you can supply dynamic arguments to the command just like you were calling a command from shell.

The format is

```
setprop ctl.start service:arg1 arg2 arg3..
```

It must be a oneshot service, for example you can define a dhcpcd service like:

```sh
service dhcpcd /system/bin/dhcpcd -B
        group dhcp wifi system
        disabled
        oneshot
```

And set the target interface dynamically:

```
setprop ctl.start dhcpcd:eth0
```

"init" will then execute "dhcpcd -B eth0" with appropriate permissions.
