## Advertising Basics

Bluetooth devices can send advertising packets (PDUs) to broadcast data, or to allow other Bluetooth devices to find them and connect to them.

Bluetooth low energy uses 40 different RF channels. Three of these channels are called primary advertising channels, and are used for communication outside of connections. This includes:


    - advertisements
    - scan requests
    - scan responses
    - connection requests.

The remaining 37 channels are primarily used for data exchanges within BLE connections. In the following figure, this is illustrated. The primary advertising channels are placed to avoid the Wi-Fi channels since Wi-Fi transmissions cause noise on the BLE channels.

>On advertisement channels, both advertisement, scan request and connection request packets are sent. So if there is too much noise on the advertisement channel, the devices will be unable to establish a connection. This is why the advertisement channels are placed the farthest away from the Wi-Fi channels. In addition, they are placed far away from each other.

With Bluetooth 5, new advertisement types are added that expand the possibilities of sending data in advertisement packets. The new advertisement packet types are listed in the Advertising Packets section. Bluetooth 5 opens for advertising on the 37 data channels. When advertisements are sent on the data channels, they are called secondary advertising channels.


## Advertising Parameters

The following table summarizes the parameters that can be configured for advertising.

The advertising channels for legacy advertising are channel 37 (2402 MHz), channel 38 (2426 MHz), and channel 39 (2480 MHz). The device can advertise on one, two or three of these. The following diagram shows an advertising event when advertising on all three channels.

Note that the same data (`ADV_IND`) is sent on all three channels. Since the packet is quite small (remember that the advertisement data is no more than 31 bytes), it takes less than 10 ms to send it. The device can be modified to advertise only on selected channels. Advertising on fewer channels will save power, however using more channels will increase the likelihood of a peer device receiving the packet. The user can configure the advertising interval based on the application use case. For example, if a door lock is advertising at a slower interval, it will take longer for the peer device to connect to the door lock which would adversely affect user experience.


## Advertising Packets

The advertising data consists up to 31 bytes of user configurable data. An additional 31 bytes can be sent as a scan response to a scan request. There are eight different types of advertising packets, listed in the table below. The last four (in bold type) have been added with Bluetooth 5. They are called extended advertisement PDUs. The packets that start with ADV_ are transmitted on the primary advertising channels. The packets that start with AUX_ are transmitted on the secondary advertisement channels.

For example, if you want to advertise on LE Coded PHY (long range), the device would use the `ADV_EXT_IND` to advertise on the primary advertising channels. The `ADV_EXT_IND` contain a pointer to a `AUX_ADV_IND` that would be transmitted on a secondary advertisement channel.

An other example: If the device wants to send a lot of advertisement data, it can advertise with `ADV_EXT_IND` as usual. The `ADV_EXT_IND` would contain a pointer to a `AUX_ADV_IND`. If there is a lot of adv data to send, the `AUX_ADV_IND` could be sent on the LE 2M PHY for speed. The `AUX_ADV_IND` can contain a pointer to a `AUX_CHAIN_IND` which contains the remaining adv data. In this case, you are not allowed to advertise in connectable or scannable mode.

The above table shows that the legacy advertising modes use the 31 payload bytes for advertisement data except directed advertising, which uses the 6-byte device address of the initiating device as adv data. Directed advertisements have an intended receiving device (scanner), while undirected advertisements do not have a specific intended receiver. In addition, all the legacy advertising types enable sending a scan response, except for the directed and non-connectable advertising.


It may be worth noting that for directed advertising, the advertisement duration can not be higher than 1.28 seconds.
