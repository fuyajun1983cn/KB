### Following steps are used when associating with an AP using WPA:    
* wpa_supplicant requests the kernel driver to scan neighboring BSSes
* wpa_supplicant selects a BSS based on its configuration
* wpa_supplicant requests the kernel driver to associate with the chosen BSS
* if WPA-EAP: integrated IEEE 802.1X Supplicant completes EAP authentication with the authentication server (proxied by the Authenticator in the AP)
* If WPA-EAP: master key is received from the IEEE 802.1X Supplicant
* If WPA-PSK: wpa_supplicant uses PSK as the master session key
* wpa_supplicant completes WPA 4-Way Handshake and Group Key Handshake with the Authenticator (AP). WPA2 has integrated the initial Group Key Handshake into the 4-Way Handshake.
* wpa_supplicant configures encryption keys for unicast and broadcast
* normal data packets can be transmitted and received
