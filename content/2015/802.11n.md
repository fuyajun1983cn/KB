* Wider 40 MHz channels also have a higher potential to interfere with non-802.11 technologies such as Bluetooth, which is one of the major reasons why 40 MHz channels must be disabled by default in the 2.4 GHz band.


* Increasing the speed of a network can be done in two ways. 
First, protocol designers can try to increase the raw speed as measured by the transmission rate, which might be termed the “go faster” approach. 
Second, protocol designers can increase the speed perceived by users by increasing the efficiency of the protocol, to transmit more bits within a given period of time, an approach which might be called the “efficiency” approach. 

* 802.11n:
use MIMO, Early 802.11n products transmitted at a data rate of 150 Mbps, and the standard laid out a clear path to data rates of up to 600 Mbps.
