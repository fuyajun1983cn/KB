### 半导体生产可以分解成三步：  
  1. FEOL(front-end-of-line)   
     FEOL covers wafer(晶元) production, lithography(石印), etch, and
     deposition. Broadly speaking, FEOL refers to the process of
     manufacturing transistors.      
  2. BEOL(back-end-of-line)      
     Once the individual components of a chip have been created, they
     have to be connected together. BEOL refers to this process. The
     metal layers, insulating layers, vias, and bond sites are all
     added during this phase.      
  3. Packaging
