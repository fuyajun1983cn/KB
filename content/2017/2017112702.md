## Description

Allow ringstones on the phone to be played on Bluetooth headsets. 

When in-band ringing is enabled, instead of hearing a default beeping or notification sound that comes pre-configured with your Bluetooth device, your phoneâ€™s custom ringtone plays through the connected speakers or headphones.
