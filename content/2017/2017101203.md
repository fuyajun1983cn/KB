- *NAP*

  Non-significant Address Part (2 bytes). Contains first 16 bits of the OUI. The NAP value is used in Frequency Hopping Synchronization frames.

- *UAP*

  Upper Address Part (1 byte). Contains remaining 8 bits of the OUI. The UAP value is used for seeding in various Bluetooth specification algorithms.

- *LAP*

  Lower Address Part (3 bytes). This portion of Bluetooth Address is allocated by the vendor of device. The LAP value uniquely identifies a Bluetooth device as part of the Access Code in every transmitted frame.

The LAP and the UAP make the significant address part (SAP) of the Bluetooth Address.

the reserved LAP address 0x9E8B00 - 0x9E8B3F
the genearl inquiry LAP is 0x9E8B33

## Access Code

   - device access code(DAC)

     used during page, page scan and page response.  derived from paged device's BD_ADDR.

   - channel access code(CAC)

     used in CONNECTION state and synchronization train, synchronization scan substate. derived from master's BD_ADDR. 

   - inquiry access code(IAC)

     inquiry substate. 


all access code are derived from the LAP of a device address or inquiry address.

access code also indicates to the receiver the arrival of a packet.
it's used for timing synchronization and offset compression.
