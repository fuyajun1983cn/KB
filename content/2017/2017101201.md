## Genearl information

the baseband layer is responsible for the conversion of data packets into their assigned type of RF packets which contain a header and user data.

the packet header usually holds destination device address and control information, in bluetooth, ususally holds the piconet ID(master address),
device id(number assigned to the slave device) and may include packet structure and other packet control related information.

   the access code and header use the same modulation mode as Basic Rate packets.  other field use Enhanced Data Rate modulation.
   The guard time allows for the transition between the modulation modes.
