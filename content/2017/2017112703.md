## Description

Android O will support Sony’s LDAC wireless audio coding tech which can transfer more data compared to Bluetooth on your standard smartphone. LDAC can apparently get a bitrate up to 990kbps compared to standard wireless audio coding which falls around 330kbps. **In layman’s terms, this will allow audio to be transmitted closer to its original quality. Sony already packs this tech in its Android phones, but since it’s now a part of Android O natively, it means that any OEM will be able to use it with compatible audio devices.**
