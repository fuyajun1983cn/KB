When we encountered HFP no sound issue, commonly we need to check below 3 aspects:

### Aspect 1. If the SCO connection was established successfully or not

In snoop log, we can see log as below:

```
526	Command	0x0428	Setup_Synchronous_Connection	17	21	00:00:00.000336	6/21/2017	10:59:13.429790 AM	
531	Event	0x0428	Setup_Synchronous_Connection	Command Status	Success	4	7	00:00:00.000542	6/21/2017 10:59:13.433252 AM	
536	Event	Synchronous Connection	Complete	0x0003	17	20	 00:00:00.008079	6/21/2017	10:59:13.449996 AM	
```

In logcat log, we can see logs as below:

```
bt-btif : BTA AG SCO State Change: [3] -> [6] after Event [7]
```

### Aspect 2. If the HF status indicator updated to HF or not

Commonly, after a phone call set up, we should be able to find below indicators in snoop log. If status were incorrect, may lead no sound issue.

### Aspect 3. If the audio data normal or not

If both SCO connection and HF indicators are correct. Then we need to check Audio data from QXDM and OTA.

In QXDM log:

you need to check the 0x1586-0x410E and the 0x1586-0x410F

xxx.isf.0x1586.pcm.0x1. 0x410E.0x1.rx.wav : LPASS -> BT FW, used for  SCO rx

xxx.isf.0x1586.pcm.0x1. 0x410F.0x1.rx.wav : LPASS <- BT FW, used for  SCO tx

In OTA log:

You also can extract the Audio data and check if the data is correct or not. Methods depends on different OTA tools.
