CCI is a common deployment issue that can be resolved with configuration changes. Co-channel interference is when transmissions occur on the same frequency in the same area.

In the example below, Belkin:9D:06:C4 and Apple:Cb:07:EF both service an area on channel 1. Both APs can hear each other at a strong signal level. The APs have effectively combined into a bigger contention domain. Each device that both APs service will need to contend with each other for air time.

In a co-channel interference environment, stations follow CSMA/CA and will check if the medium is busy. If the medium is idle, they will attempt to transmit data. If it is not idle, they will defer transmission until it is.

Co-channel interference negatively impacts wireless networks when there’s an increase in contention. An example is a high-density area. As stations attempt to use the medium, they may need to wait for others to complete their transmissions. When this occurs, stations update their timers based on a network allocation vector (NAV) value within frames each station can read.

From the end user’s perspective, it can appear that WiFi is slow or not operable at all.
