```sh
Memory: 384MB = 384MB total
Memory: 385876k/385876k available, 7340k reserved, 0K highmem
Virtual kernel memory layout:
    vector  : 0xffff0000 - 0xffff1000   (   4 kB)
    fixmap  : 0xfff00000 - 0xfffe0000   ( 896 kB)
    DMA     : 0xfde00000 - 0xffe00000   (  32 MB)
    vmalloc : 0xd8800000 - 0xe0000000   ( 120 MB)
    lowmem  : 0xc0000000 - 0xd8000000   ( 384 MB)
    modules : 0xbf000000 - 0xc0000000   (  16 MB)
      .init : 0xc0008000 - 0xc0021000   ( 100 kB)
      .text : 0xc0021000 - 0xc036b000   (3368 kB)
      .data : 0xc0384000 - 0xc03b05c0   ( 178 kB)
```

- The .modules, .init, .text and .data sections refer to the kernel executable itself. The kernel’s address in virtual memory is usually hardcoded at 0xc0008000 (CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET + TEXT_OFFSET). The ‘vector’ section refers to the processor’s exception table and is usually defined as CONFIG_VECTORS_BASE.

- The ‘vector’ section refers to the processor’s exception table and is usually defined as CONFIG_VECTORS_BASE.

- The ‘fixmap‘ region refers to an area of virtual memory set aside for simple and fixed virtual memory mappings whose virtual addresses must be known at compile time and whose corresponding physical addresses can be changed later on. It lives at FIXADDR_START through to FIXADDR_TOP. Though it seems rarely used under ARM.

- The ‘DMA’ region refers to memory set aside for DMA operations – defined by CONSISTENT_BASE and CONSISTENT_END.

- Finally the ‘vmalloc’ region refers to dynamic allocations of virtually contiguous memory within the kernel. It lives in an area of memory defined by VMALLOC_START through to VMALLOC_END. The VMALLOC_END macro is defined by specific platforms (we’ll find out why soon) usually in a file such as arch/arm/mach-xxx/include/mach/vmalloc.h. The VMALLOC_START address is a set distance (VMALLOC_OFFSET) away from the end of the low mem region (high_memory).
