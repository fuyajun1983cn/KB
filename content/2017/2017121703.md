This article will give a common process to debug split-A2DP no sound issue and find which module the issue was in.

When we encountered split-A2DP no sound issue, commonly we need to check command flow first. If commands are normal then we need to check the data flow.

## command flow:

For command flow, commonly we only need to check btsnoop log. In snoop log, we need to check vender split command, AVDTP command and AVRCP command if remote support AVRCP.

1.	Vender split command

    Below commands are normal vender split commands.

2.	AVDTP command

    Below commands are normal AVDTP commands

3.	AVRCP command

    If remote supports AVRCP, you also need to check the AVRCP status. During A2DP ongoing, AVRCP status should be PLAYING as below:

## data flow:

If all commands are normal but still no sound. Then we need to check data flow. As the figure above shows, the data flow was: LPASS -> BT FW -> remote. We can use QXDM, enhancement btsnoop and OTA to help us to determine which module the issue was in.

1.	QXDM log

    You can use QCAT to extract Audio data. The 0x1586-0x410E is the Audio data in LPASS which will feed to BT FW .

    xxx.isf.0x1586.pcm.0x1.0x410E.0x1.rx.wav

2.	Enhancement snoop log

    If there is no audio data received from LPASS, we can find below error in enhancement snoop:

    If A2DP ring buffer of FW overflow, we can find below error in enhancement snoop:

3.	OTA log

    In OTA, it is same as legacy non-split A2DP. You can dump Audio data, check delay etc.
