## Description


Class of device is a parameter received during the device discovery procedure
on the BR/EDR physical transport, indicating the type of device. The Class of
Device parameter is only used on BR/EDR and BR/EDR/LE devices using the
BR/EDR physical transport.


The Class of Device/Service (CoD) field has a variable format. The format is indicated using the 'Format Type
field' within the CoD. The length of the Format Type field is variable and ends with two bits different from '11'.
The version field starts at the least significant bit of the CoD and may extend upwards.

In the 'format #1' of the CoD (Format Type field = 00), 11 bits are assigned as a bit-mask (multiple bits can be
set) each bit corresponding to a high level generic category of service class. Currently 7 categories are
defined. These are primarily of a 'public service' nature. The remaining 11 bits are used to indicate device type
category and other device-specific characteristics.

Any reserved but otherwise unassigned bits, such as in the Major Service Class field, should be set to 0.

## Major Service Classes

The Major and Minor classes are intended to define a general family of devices with which any particular
implementation wishes to be associated. No assumptions should be made about specific functionality or
characteristics of any application based solely on the assignment of the Major or Minor device class.

## Major Device Classes

The Major Class segment is the highest level of granularity for defining a Bluetooth Device. The main function
of a device is used to determine the major class grouping. There are 32 different possible major classes. The
assignment of this Major Class field is defined in Table 1.3.

## The Minor Device Class field

The 'Minor Device Class field' (bits 7 to 2 in the CoD), are to be interpreted only in the context of the Major
Device Class (but independent of the Service Class field). Thus the meaning of the bits may change,
depending on the value of the 'Major Device Class field'. When the Minor Device Class field indicates a device
class, then the primary device class should be reported, e.g. a cellular phone that can also work as a cordless
handset should use 'Cellular' in the minor device class field.
