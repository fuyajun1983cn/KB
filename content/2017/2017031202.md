KEYWORDS: wifi aci

Adjacent channel interference (ACI) occurs when transmissions are sent on an adjacent or partially overlapping channel. The channel bleeds over on an overlapping channel, which adds noise and interference. As a result, ACI is worse than CCI.

A station performs clear channel assessment (CCA) to determine if it can transmit on an idle medium. A received signal may get corrupted by ACI from a nearby transmitter on the overlapping frequency if that received signal is weak.

If the signal from ACI was strong enough, it would trigger a misleading CCA. A transmitter would perform CCA on its channel only to detect energy from an adjacent overlapping channel. As a result, the station defers communication.
