## Description

The Inquiry Access Code is the first level of filtering when finding Bluetooth devices and services. The main
purpose of defining multiple IACs is to limit the number of responses that are received when scanning devices
within range.

|#|LAP value|Usage|
|--|--|--|
|0|0x9E8B33|General/Unlimited Inquiry Access Code (GIAC)|
|1|0x9E8B00|Limited Dedicated Inquiry Access Code (LIAC)|
|2-63|0x9E8B01-0x9E8B32, 0x9E8B34-0x9E8B3F|RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE|

The Limited Inquiry Access Code (LIAC) is only intended to be used for limited time periods in scenarios where
both sides have been explicitly caused to enter this state, usually by user action. For further explanation of the
use of the LIAC, please refer to the Generic Access Profile.


In contrast it is allowed to be continuously scanning for the General Inquiry Access Code (GIAC) and respond
whenever inquired.
